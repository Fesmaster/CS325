<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Q: What is original about your game?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A: The game is based off of the idea that adding ingredients to a mixture changes the property. Its often seen as a   crafting system in games, but here, I am trying to make a game out of this idea.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Q: What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A: The button interaction was a bit interesting to get done, particularly with so little code. I am really satisfied how it worked. Also, the progressbars were fun. I thought about using a Phaser extendion, but then decided to use the geometry objects to create them myself.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Q: What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A: The hardest part was getting all the parts to play nicely. Particularly, learing the Phaser API. the HSVtoRGB function was really annoying to figgure out.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Q: Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Cauldron Image: This image I created myself.</li>
<li>Reload Button Image: This image I created myself.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Q: Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A: I did not copy code from any templates, and I have no idea which one resembles this the most. I certanly have not looked at all of them, and the ones I did look at were for things like creating a rect or a image, and the like.
</li>
