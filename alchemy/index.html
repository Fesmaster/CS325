<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Q: What is original about your game?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A: Not much. From the template I changed the 
physics engine to support scaling the image, 
otherwise it would not fit in the bounds. This 
required that I reimplement the mouse attraction.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Q: What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A: Not much in this demo.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Q: What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A: Changeing the physics engine. The one used 
in the template does not support scaling, 
which was somthing I needed for this image.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Q: Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Cauldron Image: This image I created myself.</li>
<li>Item Images: <a href="https://vxresource.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/biggest-iconset-ever/">https://vxresource.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/biggest-iconset-ever/</a> Note: I did remove the individual tiles and add the background (made by me) to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Q: Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A: I used some stuff from a number of templates, but mostly had to write it myself with them as a guide. No copy-paste.
